                    <p>Hi, I'm Marco! I'm currently in my senior year studying Computer Science at San Francisco State
                        University.</p>
                    <p>After I earn my degree, I plan on taking some time to travel before starting a job.</p>
                    <p>When I am not coding and learning new tech, I enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures.</p>
                    <p>I also like going to Tahoe and snowboarding whenever I get the chance!</p>
